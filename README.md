# LCZLock
LCZLock is a plugin that locks the elevators in Light Containment at the start of the match for a set amount of time.\
This plugin was orignally made by [Ruemena](https://github.com/Ruemena), but it hasn't been updated in a couple months. So I decided to update it to EXILED 8.0.\
I plan to update this to any future EXILED versions, aswell as trying to add new things, or change certain things.
